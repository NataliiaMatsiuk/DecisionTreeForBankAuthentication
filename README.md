# DecisionTreeForBankAuthentication
In previous research I have implemented K-means clustering model to solve the banknote authentication problem. But the model was not good. So I decided to use other methods to analyze data.
In this project Decision Tree and Random Forest are used. 
As we can see from the results of the project, both of mentioned methods are good to classification problem.
